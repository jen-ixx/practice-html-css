        <h2>Who is Conor Mcgregor?</h2> <br>
        <p class="text">Conor McGregor rose from a tough neighborhood to become the biggest star in the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). After joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 2013, "The Notorious" unified the featherweight division with his title win in 2015, and the following year he became a two-division champion by winning the lightweight title. McGregor also famously fought boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017. <i>He abruptly retired from MMA in March 2019, before returning with a victory in January 2020.</i></p> <br>

        <h2>Early Life</h2> <br>
  		<p>Conor Anthony McGregor was born to parents Tony and Margaret McGregor on July 14, 1988, in Dublin, Ireland. Raised in the rough working-class section of Crumlin, McGregor enjoyed playing soccer as a boy before finding an outlet for his aggression in boxing. He was a member of the Crumlin Boxing Club from age 11 to 17, winning a Dublin Novice Championship during that time.</p> <br>
  		<p> <i>In his later teen years, McGregor began training in the still little-known sport of mixed martial arts, under John Kavanagh. He also found a job as an apprentice plumber but elected to forego the profession, over his parents' objections, to pursue his dream of becoming a professional fighters.</i></p> <br>

  		<h2>MMA Career</h2> <br>
  		<h3>Cage warriors</h3>

He lost two of his first six fights before reeling off an impressive winning streak, claiming both the featherweight championship and the lightweight championship in 2012.</p> <br>

  		<h3>UFC</h3>
  		<p>Signed by UFC President Dana White in early 2013, McGregor impressed with a first-round knockout in his April debut for the organization.
